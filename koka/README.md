In order to run this example, please download & install Koka lang. It can be found at: https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/kokaspec.html

**Note**: This probably won't work at the Rise4Fun online editor. I guess it is outdated, so you should have a running installation to run the example. 

If you do, simply:

```
cd /kokapath
./out/debug/koka-0.9.0-dev test.kk
```
